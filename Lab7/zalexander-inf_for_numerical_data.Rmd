## North Carolina births

In 2004, the state of North Carolina released a large data set containing 
information on births recorded in this state. This data set is useful to 
researchers studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant 
mothers and the birth of their children. We will work with a random sample of 
observations from this data set.

## Exploratory analysis

Load the `nc` data set into our workspace.

```{r load-data, eval=TRUE}
load("more/nc.RData")
```

We have observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some 
numerical. The meaning of each variable is as follows.

variable         | description
---------------- | -----------
`fage`           | father's age in years.
`mage`           | mother's age in years.
`mature`         | maturity status of mother.
`weeks`          | length of pregnancy in weeks.
`premie`         | whether the birth was classified as premature (premie) or full-term.
`visits`         | number of hospital visits during pregnancy.
`marital`        | whether mother is `married` or `not married` at birth.
`gained`         | weight gained by mother during pregnancy in pounds.
`weight`         | weight of the baby at birth in pounds.
`lowbirthweight` | whether baby was classified as low birthweight (`low`) or not (`not low`).
`gender`         | gender of the baby, `female` or `male`.
`habit`          | status of the mother as a `nonsmoker` or a `smoker`.
`whitemom`       | whether mom is `white` or `not white`.

1.  What are the cases in this data set? How many cases are there in our sample?

**Each case in this dataset are birth details for babies born in North Carolina. There are 1,000 cases in this sample.**  

As a first step in the analysis, we should consider summaries of the data. This
can be done using the `summary` command:

```{r summary, eval=TRUE}
summary(nc)
```

As you review the variable summaries, consider which variables are categorical 
and which are numerical. For numerical variables, are there outliers? If you 
aren't sure or want to take a closer look at the data, make a graph.

**It looks like 'mature', 'premie', 'marital', 'lowbirthweight', 'gender', 'habit, and 'whitemom' are categorical variables and 'fage', 'mage', 'weeks', 'visits', 'gained', and 'weight' are numerical variables.**  

**However, it would be helpful to check to see if there are any outliers for 'weight', since it is such an important factor on the baby's health:**  

```{r}
hist(nc$weight)
boxplot(nc$weight)

summary(nc$weight)
```
**We can see that there are a fair amount of outliers for a baby's weight -- those that have a registered birth weight of under about 4 pounds is considered uncommon, and a few babies have registered birth weights above 10.5 pounds, which is also considered uncommon in this sample. The boxplot shows these outliers.**  

Consider the possible relationship between a mother's smoking habit and the 
weight of her baby. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps 
us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research
questions.

2.  Make a side-by-side boxplot of `habit` and `weight`. What does the plot 
highlight about the relationship between these two variables?

**Here's the side-by-side boxplot of 'habit' and 'weight':**  
```{r}
boxplot(weight~habit,data=nc, main="Relation Between Mother's Smoking Habits and Baby's Weight", 
    ylab="Baby's Weight", xlab="Mother Smoker/Non-Smoker")
```


The box plots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can
also compare the means of the distributions using the following function to 
split the `weight` variable into the `habit` groups, then take the mean of each
using the `mean` function.

```{r by-means, eval=TRUE}
by(nc$weight, nc$habit, mean)
```

There is an observed difference, but is this difference statistically 
significant? In order to answer this question we will conduct a hypothesis test
.

## Inference

3.  Check if the conditions necessary for inference are satisfied. Note that 
you will need to obtain sample sizes to check the conditions. You can compute 
the group size using the same `by` command above but replacing `mean` with 
`length`.

```{r}
by(nc$weight, nc$habit, length)
```

**It appears that the samples are independent from one another given that this is a random sample (outlined earlier).**  

**Additionally, it appears that there is normality of this sample, given that n > or equal to 30 for both non-smoking and smoking mothers in this sample, as indicated from the test above.**  

**Therefore, both conditions for inference are satisfied.**  

4.  Write the hypotheses for testing if the average weights of babies born to 
smoking and non-smoking mothers are different.

+ **H0: There is no difference between the average weights of babies born to smoking and non-smoking mothers.**  

+ **HA: There is a difference between the average weights of babies born to smoking and non-smoking mothers.**  

Next, we introduce a new function, `inference`, that we will use for conducting
hypothesis tests and constructing confidence intervals. 

```{r inf-weight-habit-ht, eval=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
inference(y = nc$weight, x = nc$habit, est = "mean", type = "ht", null = 0, 
          alternative = "twosided", method = "theoretical")
```

Let's pause for a moment to go through the arguments of this custom function. 
The first argument is `y`, which is the response variable that we are 
interested in: `nc$weight`. The second argument is the explanatory variable, 
`x`, which is the variable that splits the data into two groups, smokers and 
non-smokers: `nc$habit`. The third argument, `est`, is the parameter we're 
interested in: `"mean"` (other options are `"median"`, or `"proportion"`.) Next
we decide on the `type` of inference we want: a hypothesis test (`"ht"`) or a 
confidence interval (`"ci"`). When performing a hypothesis test, we also need 
to supply the `null` value, which in this case is `0`, since the null 
hypothesis sets the two population means equal to each other. The `alternative`
hypothesis can be `"less"`, `"greater"`, or `"twosided"`. Lastly, the `method` 
of inference can be `"theoretical"` or `"simulation"` based.

5.  Change the `type` argument to `"ci"` to construct and record a confidence 
interval for the difference between the weights of babies born to smoking and 
non-smoking mothers.

```{r}
inference(y = nc$weight, x = nc$habit, est = "mean", type = "ci", null = 0, 
          alternative = "twosided", method = "theoretical")
```

**The confidence interval is (0.0534, 0.5777).** 

By default the function reports an interval for ($\mu_{nonsmoker} - \mu_{smoker}$)
. We can easily change this order by using the `order` argument:

```{r inf-weight-habit-ci, eval=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
inference(y = nc$weight, x = nc$habit, est = "mean", type = "ci", null = 0, 
          alternative = "twosided", method = "theoretical", 
          order = c("smoker","nonsmoker"))
```

* * *

## On your own

-   Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average length of pregnancies 
(`weeks`) and interpret it in context. Note that since you're doing inference 
on a single population parameter, there is no explanatory variable, so you can 
omit the `x` variable from the function.

```{r}
inference(y = nc$weeks, est = "mean", type = "ci", null = 0, 
          alternative = "twosided", method = "theoretical")
```
**The 95% confidence interval for the average length of pregnancies for this sample (in weeks) is: 38.15 weeks to 38.52 weeks.**  

-   Calculate a new confidence interval for the same parameter at the 90% 
confidence level. You can change the confidence level by adding a new argument 
to the function: `conflevel = 0.90`.

```{r}
inference(y = nc$weeks, est = "mean", type = "ci", null = 0, 
          alternative = "twosided", method = "theoretical", conflevel = 0.90)
```
**The 90% confidence interval for the average length of pregnancies for this sample (in weeks) is: 38.18 weeks to 38.49 weeks.** 

-   Conduct a hypothesis test evaluating whether the average weight gained by 
younger mothers is different than the average weight gained by mature mothers.

+ **H0: There is no difference between the average weight gained by younger mothers and the average weight gained by mature mothers.**  

+ **HA: There is a difference between the average weight gained by younger mothers and the average weight gained by mature mothers.**  

```{r}
inference(y = nc$gained, x = nc$mature, est = "mean", type = "ht", null = 0, 
          alternative = "twosided", method = "theoretical")

inference(y = nc$gained, x = nc$mature, est = "mean", type = "ci", null = 0, 
          alternative = "twosided", method = "theoretical")
```

**According to the hypothesis test, it appears that there is no difference between the average weight gained by younger mothers and the average weight gained by mature mothers. With a p-value = 0.1686, and a confidence interval that spans 0, we can accept the null hypothesis.**  

-   Now, a non-inference task: Determine the age cutoff for younger and mature 
mothers. Use a method of your choice, and explain how your method works.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
nc %>% 
  group_by(mature, mage) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(mage) %>% 
  summarise(maxage = max(mage), minage = min(mage)) %>% 
  gather(x, n, 2:3) %>% 
  select(mature, n) %>% 
  filter((max(n) & mature == 'younger mom') | (min(n) & mature == 'mature mom')) %>% 
  arrange(mature, -n) %>% 
  filter(!row_number()==1 & !row_number()==n())
```

**Using tidyverse and some data wrangling methods, I've found that the cutoff is between 34 and 35 years of age for those considered to be a younger mother from mature mothers.**  

**I was able to use group_by and summary methods in order to find the min and max age broken down by the categorical variable of mature, then finding the min and max values of those groupings, I was able to isolate the min age for mature moms and the max age for younger moms.**  

-   Pick a pair of numerical and categorical variables and come up with a 
research question evaluating the relationship between these variables. 
Formulate the question in a way that it can be answered using a hypothesis test
and/or a confidence interval. Answer your question using the `inference` 
function, report the statistical results, and also provide an explanation in 
plain language.

**Research question: Is there a difference in the average weight of a baby depending on whether or not a mother is considered a younger mother or a mature mother?**  

**To answer this question, we'll assume the following hypotheses:**

+ **H0: There is no difference between the average weights of babies born from younger mothers and the average weights of a babies born from mature mothers.**  
+ **HA: There is a difference between the average weights of babies born from younger mothers and the average weights of a babies born from mature mothers.**  

```{r}
inference(y = nc$weight, x = nc$mature, est = "mean", type = "ht", null = 0, 
          alternative = "twosided", method = "theoretical")

inference(y = nc$weight, x = nc$mature, est = "mean", type = "ci", null = 0, 
          alternative = "twosided", method = "theoretical")
```

**We accept the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the average weights of babies born from younger mothers and the average weights of babies born from mature mothers. Since the p-value = 0.186, and the 95% confidence interval spans 0, we can accept the null hypothesis.**  

**In plain language, it appears that the age of the mother bearing a child will not have an impact on their baby's birth weight.**
